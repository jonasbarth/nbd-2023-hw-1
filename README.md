# Steps to generate plots for Part 1

## 1. Install dependencies

In the root of the project, run the following from the commandline:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 2. Run part1 python script

In the root of the project, run:

```bash
python part1.py

This should generate **three** plots:

- img/connectivity_complexity.eps
- img/er-graph_connectivity.eps
- img/r-random_graph_connectivity.eps
